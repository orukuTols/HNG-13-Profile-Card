            <h2>Bio:</h2>
            <p>I am Oruku Toluwalase, a passionate front-end developer currently navigating the challenges and excitement of the HNG Internship. I love turning design into clean, responsive, and functional code.</p>

                <li>Successfully complete all stages of the internship.</li>
                <li>Master advanced JavaScript concepts, particularly asynchronous programming.</li>
                <li>Collaborate effectively with a team on a major project.</li>
                <li>Build a portfolio piece that showcases production-level code quality.</li>

        <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
            <h2>Areas of low confidence:</h2>
            <p>My lowest confidence lies in mastering complex backend technologies, specifically when integrating RESTful APIs into large-scale applications. I need to dedicate more time to securing my understanding of Node.js and database schema design.</p>

        <section data-testid="test-about-future-note">
            <h2>Note to future self:</h2>
            <p>Tolu, don't forget the enthusiasm you felt right now! Take breaks, commit often, and remember that every bug is a puzzle, not a failure. You've come this far because you didn't give up. Now, go conquer the next stage!</p>

        <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
            <h2>Extra thoughts:</h2>
            <p>I am genuinely excited about the collaborative learning environment. Itâ€™s challenging but being able to share solutions and learn from others' mistakes (and successes!) has been invaluable. I appreciate the focus on real-world coding standards.</p>
